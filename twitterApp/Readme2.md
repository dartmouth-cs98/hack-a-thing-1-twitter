## Hack-A-Thing-2

### What I Learned / What I Did:
*For this Hack-A-Thing, I explored three main things:
   *Setting up and using an API (attempted)
   *Gained familiarity with various well known NLP algorithms and packages.
   *Exploring the basic functionality of several python packages.

*With the api:
  1. I registered with twitter to get my consumer and authentication keys. I attempted to connect to my account using tweepy, but was unable to authenticate. I am not sure why I had this problem, and stack overflow was not able to help me.

*Within NLP, I explored the following topics:
    1. Cleaning and preparing text with nltk: tokenization, stemming, use of stop words, and other preprocessing techniques. 
       * For the model, I used their tokenization method to break strings apart by punctuation. If I understood the model better, I would use a better tokenization method. (ex. Bob's would be broken apart using their method.)
    2. I chose to try and implement a Naive Bayes model & Support Vector Machine. I found several interesting readings that explained the Naive Bayes model, and followed a kaggle tutorial to develop the model over the 'Toxic Comments Dataset' from 'Google Jigsaw'.
      * I tried to understand the model and how the code worked. As I went through each part, I tried to make small changes / customizations, such as loading a stop words list from nltk instead of leaving the option empty.


* I also gained some experience using the following python packages:
  1. numpy for ...
  2. I used Pandas Dataframes to read the Kaggle's csv data. I gained familiarity with several methods for manipulating and representing Pandas dataframes.
