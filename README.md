# Hack-a-Thing-1

## The Goal
 My goal was to start learning about the field of NLP. To do this, I wanted to start by finding a simple tool I could use to understand some of the basic concepts/tools/goals of the field. I chose Python NLTK and to go through the NLTK Book since it starts from the very beginning. Instead of having a specific project in mind, my goal was to go through as much of the book as possible so I could understand the problems that I could realistically tackle. I managed to  go through the first three chapters, which covered:
 - the basic concepts/goals of the field : Word sense disambiguation, pronoun resolutions, question answering and machine translation.
 - Corpuses, basic lexical information, and frequency distributions
 - How to source and manipulate raw text with NLTK (from websites, corpuses outside of NLTK, etc..

I tried to follow many of the exercises in the book with the python terminal intrepreter, and copied the terminal output into text files. Most of the exercises were simple functions demonstrating the various functions/properties of the toolkit. 

## People Involved
I worked alone on this project.

## What I Learned
I learned about various python libraries. Working through part of this book has helped me understand a number of the basci definitions and concepts (like what a corpus is and why its important; what are the various types of lexical information researchers use) but did not allow me to dive in depth into any specificproblem/algorithm/etc. I did not come out of this assignment with a defined, built project.

## What Didn't Work
Because I approached this project in an unstructured way, I believe I learned less than I would have if I tackled a concrete problem. However, without the background I did learn throughout this week, I never would have been able to articulate a realistic problem.
